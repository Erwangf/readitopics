/* How to install the Windows version of the TreeTagger                     */
/****************************************************************************/

This is the Windows distribution of the TreeTagger.

It contains the following files:

- tree-tagger.exe: the tagger program

- train-tree-tagger.exe: the training program

- utf8-tokenize.perl: A Perl script which transforms the tagger input
                    into one-word-perl-line format

- *-abbreviations:  abbreviation lists required by the tokenizer

- tag-*.bat:        batch files for different languages which call 
                    the tokeniser and the tagger 

- chunk-*.bat	    batch files for POS tagging and chunking


Installation
------------

1. Install a Perl interpreter (if you have not already installed one).
   You can download a Perl interpreter for Windows for free at
   http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/

2. Extract the zip file (if it was not extracted yet) and move the
   TreeTagger directory to the root directory of drive C:\.

3. Download the parameter files for the languages you need, decompress
   them (e.g. using Winzip or 7zip) and move them to the subdirectory TreeTagger/lib.
   Rename the parameter files to <language>-utf8.par
   Example: Rename french-par-linux-3.2-utf8.bin to french-utf8.par

   Non-UTF8 parameter files are not supported anymore.

4. Add the path C:\TreeTagger\bin to the PATH environment
   variable. The necessary steps differ from one Windows version to the other.

5. Open a command prompt window and type the command
   set PATH=C:\TreeTagger\bin;%PATH%

6. Go to the directory C:\TreeTagger
   cd c:\TreeTagger

7. Now you can test the tagger, e.g. by analyzing this file with the command
   tag-english INSTALL.txt

If you install the TreeTagger in a different directory, you have to
modify the first path in the batch files tag-*.bat using an editor
such as Wordpad.


Michaela Atterer told me that she had difficulties to install the
TreeTagger on a Windows XP system. She recommends the following
work-around.

4. Windows XP:
-Right click on "My Computer"
-Select the "Advanced" tab
-Click on "Environment Variables"
-click on New: enter PATH and C:\TreeTagger\bin\;%PATH%

If the files have been unpacked into a single directory, you should
restore the following directory structure:

TreeTagger:
INSTALL.txt  README.txt  bin  cmd  lib

TreeTagger/bin:
tag-english.bat  tag-german.bat   tag-spanish.bat        tree-tagger.exe
tag-french.bat   tag-italian.bat  train-tree-tagger.exe

TreeTagger/cmd:
mwl-lookup.perl  tokenize.pl

TreeTagger/lib:
english-abbreviations  german-abbreviations   spanish-abbreviations
french-abbreviations   italian-abbreviations  spanish-mwls


Note that the TreeTagger comes without a graphical interface. You have
to run it by entering a command in a command line window. If you prefer 
a graphical interface, try the one provided by Ciarán Ó Duibhín at
